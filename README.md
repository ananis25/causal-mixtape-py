## Overview

This repository hosts the datasets used for exercises in the textbook [“Casual Inference:
The Mixtape”](http://scunning.com/stata.html) by Scott Cunningham, as csv files. 

Also use to put code as I work through the textbook, hopefully soon enough.

## Attribution

Credits due to @johnson-shuffle's [repository](https://github.com/johnson-shuffle/mixtape) for the datasets since I can't parse how the Stata commands to download the datasets work (or for that matter, even write a for loop in R).
